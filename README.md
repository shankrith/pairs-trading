### Pairs Trading with Cointegration and Kalman Filters

This project is a pairs trading exercise using ETF and stock data from NYSE and NASDAQ. I have considered data from 2015 to 2023 with a cointegration window of 2 years to create a trading strategy of 3 - 6 months, depending on exit rules. The entry and exit points are based on the spread which is calculated using Kalman filters. I am currently working on testing the same strategy using Linear Regression instead of Kalman Filters to calculate the spread.
