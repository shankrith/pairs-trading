### Pairs Trading with Cointegration and Kalman Filters

This project is based on the codes given in Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading by Stefan Jansen. I have made some significant changes to the datasets chosen and the timeframes considered, and some minor changes to the entry - exit strategy. This is purely a research exercise for me to understand how a pairs trading strategy works and the mechanisms involved. To run these codes, download data from STOOQ (ETFs and stocks) and use data from 2015 to 2023.
