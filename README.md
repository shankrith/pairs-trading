### Pairs Trading with Cointegration and Kalman Filters

This project is a pairs trading exercise using ETF and stock data from NYSE and NASDAQ. It is based on the codes available in Stefan Jansen's Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading. I have considered data from 2015 to 2023 with a cointegration window of 2 years to create a trading strategy of 3 - 6 months, depending on exit rules. The entry and exit points are based on the spread which is calculated using Kalman filters. The Kalman Filter codes and trading rules are picked up from the textbook as a learning exercise. I am currently working on testing the same strategy using Linear Regression instead of Kalman Filters to calculate the spread.
